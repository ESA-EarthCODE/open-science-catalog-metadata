  "description": "Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the\u00a0climate\u00a0on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the\u00a0climate system\u00a0(internal variability), or to variations in natural or\u00a0anthropogenic\u00a0external\u00a0forcing\u00a0(external variability).

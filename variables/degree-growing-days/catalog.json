    "description": "Growing degree days for a given crop are calculated each day, as the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, minus a certain base temperature, where this base temperature represents the threshold under which that crop will not grow. Growing degree days are a heuristic tool that measures heat accumulation for crops from sowing through harvest, with phenological transitions occurring after a certain accumulation of growing degree days.",

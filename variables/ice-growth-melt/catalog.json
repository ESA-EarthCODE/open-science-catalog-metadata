  "description": "Pertaining to the measurement of ice growth/melting rates, and annual changes in those rates. Melt of the ice can occur at various stages: puddle, thaw holes, dried ice, rotten ice, flodded ice, and frozen puddle. Developing sea ice (or growth) takes on the following stages: New Ice, Youg Ice, First-Year Ice, Old Ice. Lake Ice development goes through the following stages: New Lake Ice, Thin Lake Ice, Medium Lake Ice, Thick Lake Ice, and Very Thick Lake Ice. In Oceanography: Refers to the melting sea ice or the growth of sea ice and its impact on the salinity concentration in the ocean.",

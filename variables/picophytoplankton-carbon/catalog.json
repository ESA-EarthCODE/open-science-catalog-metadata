  "description": "Mass concentration of picophytoplankton expressed as carbon in sea water [mg C m-3]. Marine picophytoplankton, which mainly include the autotrophic Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryotes, are autotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes with an equivalent spherical diameter of less than 2-3 nm. Their abundance and distributions in the ocean have been well-studied during the past two decades. Now it is well known that picophytoplankton are ubiquitous and abundant (i.e., 102 to 106 cells mL-1) in the photic zone and contribute significantly to autotrophic carbon biomass and primary production (PP) (Worden et al., 2004, 2015; Jardillier et al., 2010; Buitenhuis et al., 2012).

  "description": "An alpha particle has positive charge and consists of two protons and two neutrons (the nucleus of a helium atom). Flux is the rate of flow through a reference surface, measured in particles per unit area.The directional flux is the flux limited to a certain solid angle as a function of the direction (pitch angle).",

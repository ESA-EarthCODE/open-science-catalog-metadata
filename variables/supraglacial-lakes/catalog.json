  "description": "Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are meltwater bodies that accumulate in surface depressions on glaciers or ice sheets, ranging in size from a few meters to several tens of kilometers. They play a significant role in the mass balance of ice sheets. By reducing surface albedo, they increase the absorption of solar radiation, which enhances melting through a positive feedback mechanism.",

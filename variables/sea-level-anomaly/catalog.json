  "description": "A sea level anomaly (SLA) reveals the regional extent of anomalous water levels in the coastal ocean which can indicate unusual water temperatures, salinities, average monthly winds, atmospheric pressures, and/or coastal currents. A sea level anomaly, as defined by NOAA's National Ocean Service, occurs when the 5-month running average of the interannual variation is at least 0.1 meters (4 inches) greater than or less than the long-term trend. The interannual variation is the monthly mean sea level after the trend and the average seasonal cycle are removed.",

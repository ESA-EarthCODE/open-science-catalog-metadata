  "description": "NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI) correlates heating and cooling degree-day data with population. A hot summer in sparsely populated Wyoming will not have the same impact on energy use as a hot summer in the Mid-Atlantic. June 2010 had the second highest REDTI on record due to especially hot temperatures in the heavily populated South and Southeast regions. The REDTI is measured on a scale of zero to 100, with 100 being the highest population weighted degree day average and zero being the lowest.",

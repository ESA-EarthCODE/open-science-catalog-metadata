  "description": "Electromagnetic radiation of shorter wavelength than visible radiation but longer than x-rays. Radiation in the interval 10 to 4000 angstroms. UV radiation from the sun is responsible for many photochemical ractions in the upper atmosphere especially the formation of ozone. UV-B radiation in the range 280-320 nm can possibly have serious health effects on humans and animals.",

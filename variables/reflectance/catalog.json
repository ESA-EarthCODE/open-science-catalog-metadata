  "description": "Ratio of the intensity of reflected radiation to that of the incident radiation on a surface. A general term referring to the radiation reflected from, or scattered back through, a given surface in response to radiation incident on the surface with the same wavelength or wavelength range. In Cryosphere domain: The reflectance properties of ice bodies. A smooth ice surface will act as a near-specular reflector. As surface roughness increases, the reflection becomes diffuse. It is the ratio of the intensity of reflected radiation to that of the incident radiation on a surface. The suffix (-ance) implies a property of that particular specimen surface.",

    "description": "A binary map that indicates agricultural land which has a permanent, seasonal, or winter cover crop applied and established (vegetation emerged). Cover crops are defined as non-harvestable crops applied to otherwise active (non-fallow) agricultural lands as a management technique to reduce nutrient loss and soil erosion, to promote soil organic matter accumulation and health, and to preserve soil moisture. Cover crops are applied after a target crop has been harvested, or at the same time as the harvestable target crop (permanent cover crop).",

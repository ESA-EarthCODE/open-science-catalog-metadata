  "description": "The Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) is the dominant pattern of non-seasonal tropospheric circulation variations south of 20S, and it is characterized by pressure anomalies of one sign centered in the Antarctic and anomalies of the opposite sign centered about 40-50S. The AAO is also referred to as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). There is a Northern Hemisphere analog to the AAO, and it is called the Arctic Oscillation (or Northern Annular Mode).",

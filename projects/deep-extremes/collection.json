  "description": "DEEP EXTREMES is part of the AI4SCIENCE activity. The first AI4SCIENCE ITT was launched in 2021 and had a focus on Extreme Events, multi-Hazards and Compound Events, and contributes to the ESA Extremes and Natural Disasters Science Cluster. The DEEP EXTREMES project has a focus on compound heat and drought events at global scale, looking at detection based on long-term climate and land-surface data, combining EO archives and other observation data, with methods tailored to multivariate event detection. The principle is to start from sampling a subset of large events in Sentinel era and zooming into the events and in unaffected areas around the event with high-dimensional mini cubes. The activity then aims to train complementary deep:learning methods for prediction and understanding dynamics in such events, implement the tested and validated workflow in a cloud environment and developing it further based on community feedback. Science community engagement is planned via workshops and science discussions to further develop the proposed framework.",

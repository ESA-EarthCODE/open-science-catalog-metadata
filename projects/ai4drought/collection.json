  "description": "AI4DROUGHT is part of the AI4SCIENCE activity. The first AI4SCIENCE ITT was launched in 2021 and had a focus on Extreme Events, Multi-Hazards and Compound Events, and contributes to the ESA Extremes and Natural Disasters Science Cluster. The AI4SCIENCE ITT had 2 main objectives:Advancing Earth System Science: advancing our capacity to combine EO and AI to address a major scientific challenge: The observation, understanding and characterisation of multi-hazards, compound and cascade events and its impacts on society and ecosystems.Advancing Artificial Intelligence for EO-unlocking the full potential of Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Science with focus on two main AI challenges- physicS-driven Artificial Intelligence and explainable AI. The AI4DROUGHT project will develop a methodology for the prediction of drought climatic events over the Iberian peninsula.",

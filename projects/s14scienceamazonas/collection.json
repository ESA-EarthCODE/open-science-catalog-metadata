  "description": "The Sentinel-1 for Science Amazonas project demonstrates an operational approach for monitoring forest cover change and potential deforestation across the Amazon Basin using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time-series. Building on ESA-funded work since 2020, the project first introduced a space-time data cube framework (StatCubes) that harmonises billions of Sentinel-1 GRD backscatter pixels from 2015\u20132021 into 12/24-day mosaics, enabling a multi-temporal change detection (MCD) product based on statistical indicators and decision-tree thresholds. A second, advanced version integrates an AI-based methodology using a U-Net convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, trained on labelled backscatter stacks (VV, VH, VH/VV) derived from the StatCubes workflow. The AI model processes moving time-window stacks of 256\u00d7256 pixel patches to generate a probability-of-change surface, later thresholded and temporally harmonised with the MCD detections. \nBoth statistics-based and AI-based systems are now fully implemented on the openEO platform, enabling scalable cloud processing, on-the-fly computation of backscatter mosaics, and batch-based upscaling across large geographical extents. Post-processing merges detections from both methods, applies forest/non-forest masks, and filters out noise to produce clean, dynamic deforestation maps. The project also provides open-access scripts via GitHub and aims to extend the system toward carbon-related assessments using complementary datasets such as SRTM and JRC Forest Non-forest mask",

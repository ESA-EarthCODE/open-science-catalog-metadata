    "description": "The Sea-Flect study objective is to define, calibrate and validate an ocean surface wind speed retrieval method and retrieval method conditions using Aeolus measurements. These retrievals are used to develop a demonstrational Aeolus surface wind product. In this study, strong emphasis is put on the retrieval method and conditions as it is expected that under specific conditions a good wind speed retrieval may be hampered or may be even impossible. Characterization of these conditions is a main outcome of the project.",

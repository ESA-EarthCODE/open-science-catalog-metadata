    "description": "ILGEW project has three main scientific objectives: 1) Characterize the whistler dispersion measured from Earth low orbital altitudes, in order to analyse the ionosphere below Swarm satellites, along the propagation path of the whistlers; 2) Constrain the lightning activity that lead to favourable propagation conditions for the generation of detectable ELF whistlers at Swarm altitudes; 3) Establish the benefits that can be obtained for ionospheric models such as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) by using the information obtained from whistler\u2019s characteristics.",

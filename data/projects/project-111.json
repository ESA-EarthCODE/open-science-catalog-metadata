    "description": "This project will seek to develop a deep learning based model that is able to monitor the majority of the world\u201asubaerial volcanoes using satellite based measurements.  This algorithm will incorporate a model that is trained solely on time series of SAR data, and so does not require pre-training on databases of natural images (e.g. ImageNet).  Additionally, the model will feature complementary and diverse inputs, such as phase, coherence, and amplitude.",

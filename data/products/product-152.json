    "description": "These files are gridded topography, rates of surface elevation change, and errors as 500m and 1km posting determined from surface elevation measured by swath processing of data acquired by the interferometric radar altimeter CryoSat-2. The gridded products cover the Antarctic Ice Sheet between 2011 and 2016. These data have been processed by the University of Edinburgh and are made publicly available as part of a European Space Agency funded project involving the University of Edinburgh, isardSat UK, University of Leeds-CPOM, ENVEO. Gridded elevation and elevation change over the CryoSat-2 LRM sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are provided by CPOM.",

    "description": "A spectrally-resolved photoacclimation model was unified with a primary production model that simulated photosynthesis as a function of irradiance using a two-parameter photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) function to estimate the carbon content of marine phytoplankton based on ocean-colour remote sensing products (Sathyendranath et al. 2020 and references therein for details). The photoacclimation model contains a maximum chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio for three different phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton) that was inferred from field data, as in Sathyendranath et al. (2020). Chlorophyll-a products were obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI v5.0 dataset). Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) products were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and were corrected for inter-sensor bias in products. Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) was obtained from the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea (Ifremer). In situ datasets P-I parameters were incorporated as described in Kulk et al. (2020). Data are provided as netCDF files containing carbon products for pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton (C_picophyto, C_nanophyto and C_microphyto, respectively, in mg C m-3) and the total phytoplankton community (C_phyto in mg C m-3) for the period of 1998 to 2020 at 9 km spatial resolution. Additional variables that were used for the calculation of the phytoplankton carbon products are also provided, including chlorophyll-a (chl_a in mg m-3), photosynthetically activate radiation (par, in \u00b5mol photons m-2 d-1), mixed layer depth (mld in m) and the mean spectral nondimensional irradiance (mean_spectral_i_star)",

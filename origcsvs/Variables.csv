SST largely controls the atmospheric response to the ocean at both weather and climate time scales. Daily variations in SST can exceed 3 degrees Celsius and could alter the surface energy budget by more than 10 Wm-2 over the tropics and subtropics. Therefore, the SST and horizontal gradients in SST are also important for coupling with the atmosphere for sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction timescales.

Inland water bodies – rivers, lakes, wetlands and floodplains – play important roles in a variety of interdisciplinary applications. They are a source of both water and protein, often a means of navigation and for the production of hydroelectric power, and have been shown to be good proxy indicators of local and regional climatic change. Routine monitoring of these basins has further importance for regional and continental-scale hydrological, biochemical and climatological studies concerning, for example, the measurement of river discharges, the production of wetland methane, and the estimation of evaporation losses for land/atmosphere interactions. Changes in the stored volumes of surface water also have geodynamical implications for the Earth’s rotation and gravity, and for estimating the global water mass in relation to sea-level changes. "

  "description": "extrAIM dataset is a new merged daily precipitation product (extraim_merged_data.nc) for the Mediterranean region with the following characteristics: 1) dataset format: NetCDF; 2) spatial resolution: 25x25km; 3) temporal resolution: 1 day; 4) spatial coverage: Longitude: from -6.25 to 38.25, Latitude: 27.75 to 49; 5) Temporal coverage: 01-01-2007 to 30-09-2021; 6) Merging approach: Two-step merging (classification and regression): a) Algorithm: Random Forest for both classification and regression; b) Training strategy: Full training strategy; 7) Merged precipitation products: SM2Rain-ASCAT and GPM Late Run; 8) Reference precipitation product: EMO5; 9) Static covariates: Longitude, Latitude and Elevation, in both classification and regression step: a) Classification step: probability dry and probability dry of the 5 neighboring points around the target locations; b) Regression step: mean, standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation, of the entire series and non-zero amounts, as well as mean precipitation of the 5 neighboring points around the target locations. In addition, an ensemble of 20 synthetic realizations (equiprobable and bias-adjusted) of the merged dataset is provided (files named: extraim_realisation_XX.nc). The synthetic realisations were produced using the extrAIMs uncertainty-quantification approach and the associated conditional sampling method.",

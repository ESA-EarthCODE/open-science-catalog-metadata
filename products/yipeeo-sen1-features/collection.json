  "description": "Sentinel-1 data for the years 2016-2023 was pre-processed by TUW RS on the Vienna Scientific Cluster using the software SNAP8 and software packages developed by the TUW RS group. The processing workflow consists of the following steps:\n1. Apply precise orbit data\n2. Border-noise removal\n3. Radiometric calibration\n4. Radiometric terrain-flattening\n5. Range-Doppler terrain correction\nFor steps 4. and 5. the 30 m Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used. To extract time series on field level from the pre-processed Sentinel-1 data, several further processing steps were performed to mitigate the impact of the viewing geometry and undesired objects within or near the fields. In a first step, an incidence angle normalization to 40\u00b0 was performed. Afterwards, all pixels below a standard deviation of 5dB within one year were filtered out as they are typically stemming from radar shadow pixels or are no crop pixels. Finally, the cross-ratio was calculated by subtracting VV and VH polarized backscatter. The final time series were then stored as NetCDF files per field.\nThe aggregation of the time series from field level to NUTS2/NUTS3 level was performed in the linear domain to retrieve mathematically correct results.

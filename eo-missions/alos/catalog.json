  "description": "Launched in January 2006 and decommissioned in April 2011, ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), also known as Daichi, was a Japanese Earth observation mission. Developed by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), the mission's objectives called for high-resolution microwave imagery, for applications in cartographic mapping, regional observation, disaster monitoring and resource surveying. ALOS carried three instruments, PRISM (Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping), AVNIR-2 (Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer 2) and PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar). PRISM was a panchromatic radiometer that aimed to collect high-resolution stereo data for cartographic applications, while AVNIR-2 was a multispectral optical imager that aimed to monitor regional environmental land coverage and land use. PALSAR was a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument capable of dual-polarisation, with applications in resource exploration and environmental protection.",

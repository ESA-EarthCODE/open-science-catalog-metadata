  "description": " The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) is a joint collaboration between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the French Space Agency (CNES), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA), and was launched on December 16, 2022. A swath-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry mission, following from the Jason-1, -2 and -3 missions with innovative technology, SWOT will perform a global survey of the Earth's surface water, collecting detailed measurements of how water bodies change over time. The data collected by these surveys could improve ocean circulation models and weather predictions, while aiding in freshwater management around the world.",

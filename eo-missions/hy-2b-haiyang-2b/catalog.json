  "description": "The Haiyang-2 (HY-2) satellite series is a second generation ocean observation satellite, managed by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST). It is the follow-on mission to the first generation, HY-1A and HY-1B. HY-2â€™s primary objective was to measure ocean dynamic and regional environmental trends in the microwave spectral range. Further, parameters such as marine wind vector, marine surface heat and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) aid aero-marine forecasts for the prevention of, and relief in the event of, natural disasters. The first Haiyang satellite, HY-2A, was launched in August 2011, producing observational data until its service was terminated in December 2021. The satellite series consists of eight satellites with four currently in operation and four more planned to be launched by 2025.",
